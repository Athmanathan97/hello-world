# hello-world

just another repository

hello there, i'm just trying to learn how to use github
because my friends are utilizing the use of this site crazily that he is better in every aspect than the others
maybe i can come close to his level by starting this so-called hello-world i'm trying to edit. 
anyway, i still don't really get what to do yet.
